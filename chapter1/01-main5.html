          I find it so funny, that for the longest time, having only heard the
          audio version of "Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared"'s episode on Time, I was
          convinved there was nothing off about it.<br /><br />
          I would be singing it out loud, and nodding my head to both the normal
          and weird lyrics, though at that time I didn't perceive it that
          way.<br /><br />
          It's 3:12 as I write this.<br />

          "If we run out of time, then where does it go?<br />
          Is time even real? Does anyone know?"<br /><br />
          "Maybe time is just a construct of human perception,<br />
          an illusion created by----"<br /><br />
          "Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be fine.<br />
          ...but eventually <br /><br /><br />everyone runs out of time."
