          One of my goals for life is to get to experience as many different
          experiences as one can. <br /><br />
          It's not a horribly unique goal, I'm sure I'm just ripping it off from
          somebody smarter than me.<br /><br />
          It makes me angry when I sit in the comfort zone for too long.
          <br /><br />
          Even if a comfort zone by definition is meant to be comfortable.

          I keep comparing myself to others, and inevitably fall behind them.<br /><br />
          It's not as if I'm that long behind, but there's a brain function
          somewhere out there that sees a thing I haven't done, and perceives it
          as the coolest shit ever.<br /><br />
          If it fires rarely, I'm ecstatic to be able to just follow it.<br /><br />
          If it's firing more often however<br />................
