          Have you heard of the concept of hero projects?<br /><br />
          The concept goes as follows: everyone wants to be remembered for
          something. They want to have achieved something.<br /><br />
          Be it love, fame, winning a gold at the Olympics, the usual
          pretentious stuff.

        <div class="pretentious-text-right">
          I tried to have one hero project, and I personally think I did very
          well on that.<br /><br />
          By all objective metrics, I've probably succeeded, but the hedonic
          treadmill didn't stop right at that point.<br /><br />
          Who would've thought that there's a life after "and they lived happily
          ever after". Not me?
