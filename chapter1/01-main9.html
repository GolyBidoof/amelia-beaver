          I exist strongly in two states: being physically fit, but mentally
          exhausted, or being physically exhausted, but mentally fit.<br /><br />
          That's why I love physical activity, it keeps me sharp mentally. The
          bigger the slump, the more times you spin around your activity watch
          circles, right?<br /><br />
          I had very uncomfortable shoes for a while, and that's when I realized
          how much I depend on my legs to just be able to function normally.

          You grit your teeth, put another band-aid, a gel one, and hope that
          you'll still be able to keep walking for the next few hours.<br /><br />
          And then you get back to the hostel, 40k steps in, rip your band-aids
          off...<br /><br />
          What if "being kind to yourself" mentally is "being not kind to your
          own body", and vice-versa?<br /><br />
          Ah, the healthy coping mechanisms.
