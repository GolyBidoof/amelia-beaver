          When you're in the middle of having a serious problem, it feels
          absolutely impossible to scale it. <br /><br />
          Even if you break it down into smaller chunks and actionable things,
          you get so overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that still needs to be
          made.<br /><br />
          One of the common advice given then is to look back at the past
          problems and notice that they felt the same way, and yet still, they
          weren't that hard in the end.

          I just wish I didn't romanticize the process of being overwhelmed by
          difficult things as much as I do.<br /><br />
          You can be absolutely crushed by a thing in the moment and feeling
          like a martyr for putting even more stuff on your shoulders.<br /><br />
          I'm still mentally in the Tumblr Sad Girl era, thanks for ruining my
          life forever.
