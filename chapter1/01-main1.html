          I was thinking about Monogatari series the other day, because over the
          course of journaling I realized how some of the problems of the
          protagonists resonated with mine. <br /><br />

          It feels nice to have something to be able to just scratch that itch,
          even if you cannot relate to their problems...<br />
          <br />

          You kinda do... On a spiritual level.

          I'm so aspirational of some of those stories. It might sound weird to
          say that I might be envious of a few characters, considering the
          amount of trauma they've been going through...<br /><br />
          But above everything, I'm aspirational of them being able to stand
          back up and face the reality again.<br /><br />
          Would I be able to do something like this?
