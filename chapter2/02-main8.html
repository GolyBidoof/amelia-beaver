          And this brings us to the topic of "morals" and "caring about things".<br /><br />

          As I'm writing this, I'm on a huge vendetta against generative AI.<br /><br />

          I agree strongly with the Procreate stance on AI inside of their app, and I want to lift all my artist homies.

          ...but for fricks sake, wouldn't it just be easier if I didn't care?<br /><br />

          Didn't have to argue at work, didn't have to feel sad each time there'a a Generative AI art being used in an ad,
          just would let go of the morals sometimes?<br /><br />
          
          But there's an aspect of humanity in caring about things, and for as long as I care about something, I can know that I'm still doing reasonably well.
