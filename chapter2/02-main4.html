          It doesn't surprise me in the tiniest bit why would people stay in relationships way past their expiration date.<br /><br />

          We're all craving not to be alone, and to be able to connect to other people.<br /><br />

          And you know, things will get better in the end, so it's worth it! <br /><br />

          The thing is, I'm equally scared of being lonely and to be co-dependent on people that don't have your best interest in mind.

          Where there are people who are willing to go for another year or two of abuse, I'm already thinking of an escape plan as soon as conflicts start to emerge.<br /><br />

          And it's really funny, how most relationships with people are going to go through conflicts and it's just a part of problem solving. I'm a coward though.<br /><br />

          I've just.... met a few people I've been really intimate with......... that I never had a conflict with?
