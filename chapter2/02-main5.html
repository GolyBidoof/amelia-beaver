          Let's talk about idolizing people: or, why not to do it!<br /><br />
          Putting someone on a pedestal is the number one barrier keeping me from being intimate with someone else.<br /><br />
          Sometimes, when you idolize a person, you both consider yourselves to be really cool people, and you both like one another.<br /><br />

          You instantly begin forming a parasocial relationship with that person in your head, and maybe even an asexual squish with them?<br /><br />
          And then you never see a person for who they really are. You tread carefully around them.<br /><br />
          "What if I say something stupid and I mess it all up?"<br /><br />
          You've just messed up by not saying something stupid and letting them see you as a person.
