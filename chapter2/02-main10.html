          When you're high functioning, being envious can work as an engine to keep yourself motivated. <br /><br />

          You obviously don't want to be where you are right now, so you want to escape yourself and do something bigger.<br /><br />

          When you're low functioning though, envy turns into detest. You don't want to improve anything about yourself, 
          but likewise, you don't want for the person to be doing those things that you envy them of.

        <div class="pretentious-text-right">
          I probably don't know enough people to bring them down, but the sinking feeling in your stomach, of someone achieving something,
          and you being unable to keep up with them, so you want for them not to achieve those things, can leave me paralyzed for a while.<br /><br />
          
          I don't act on those instincts, because I know I'm low functioning then. But there are the moments when I feel scared of myself for having those thoughts.
