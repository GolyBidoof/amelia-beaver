          Left you on a cliffhanger the last time.<br /><br />

          I wasn't actually even interested in continuing, 
          but I kept getting thoughts that I was sure I couldn't have been the only one to have.<br />
          <br />

          I wish in equal parts nobody would ever find this, and that somebody would find this and
          connect on a deeper level with this one.

        <div class="pretentious-text-right">
          There was a video I saw recently on the topic of "don't overshare too much",
          that I pretty strongly disagreed with.<br /><br />

          I think it takes vulnerability in order to facilitate internal growth,
          and if you see other people seek community over things that people don't tend
          to speak about, there's a potential for a connection on a spiritual level with those people, right?
