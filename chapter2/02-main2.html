          I find high energy and low energy states of mind so interesting.<br /><br />

          I find myself thinking I can't ever achieve anything and that I'm stuck when I'm in a low energy state...<br /><br />

          ...just to flip back to the happiest girl ever as soon as I do a single thing.<br /><br />

          Whenever I'm in a low energy state, it's so hard to believe that things will get better, but as soon
          as you flip over to the high energy level, you don't understand why you had this problem in the first place.

        <div class="pretentious-text-right">
          When you get to the high energy state, you instantly start thinking about improving your life immediately!<br /><br />

          And you have just the right amount of time until you decide to put yourself to sleep. The next day, all of this motivation will be gone.<br /><br />
          
          ...so sometimes, you just don't, and you stay longer. And you feel fantastic in that moment...<br /><br />
          ...but even worse in the morning, as a result.<br /><br />
          Sustainability 101.
