          As you might have guessed by the fact you're here already, there's something about Japanese culture that draws me in,
          even though the culture has soooo many different problems that I don't even know where to start.<br /><br />

          I have met the most interesting people through their connection to the Japanese culture, and also people that had similar issues with it.

          Sometimes I just close my eyes for those issues and just enjoy another episode of Oshi no Ko, 
          until there will be just this one thing that takes me out of the whole experience.<br /><br />
          
          But even then, I sigh, I stand up and put up another episode of Kusuriya no Hitorigoto.<br /><br />

          Though ironically enough, I'd learn Japanese so much faster if I simply could not care about those issues.
