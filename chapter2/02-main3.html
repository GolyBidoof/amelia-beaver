          I struggle with the idea of self-love, but less so on myself, and more of what does the idea actually entail.<br /><br />
          There is a common exercise to build self-esteem that's called "affirmations", and it goes very straightforward:<br /><br />
          Every morning remind yourself what are your strengths and keep reminding yourself how awesome you are. <br /><br />
          The reason why it feels iffy to me is that whenever people have some really strong affirmations they've established, 
          some of them get very defensive whenever you challenge any of their affirmations. <br /><br />

        <div class="pretentious-text-right">
          Of course, it's understandable why this would happen. <br /><br />
          But my best experiences of talking about emotions with people have been with those that don't have a strong self-esteem, 
          don't self-love themselves all that much and have a weaker ego.<br /><br />
          It feels like it helps us all avoid the minefield of potentially exploding at one another each time we talk.
