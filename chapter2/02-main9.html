          I find the framing of the discussion between someone being "good" or "bad" so funny.<br /><br />
          I'm pretty sure I'm not a good person myself, while some people do make it their life goal to become "good".<br /><br />
          I hope I'm not being overtly edgy by saying anything to this extent.

        <div class="pretentious-text-right">
          The fact that the "goodness" is relative to both the time and the environment someone is in, makes it feel so strange.<br /><br />
          It's a very easy own to other people to claim that they'll be on "the wrong side of history".<br /><br />
          I can't wait not to see what wrong sides of the history I end up being in a hundred years from now.
