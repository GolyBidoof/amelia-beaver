          Being raised on the internet makes communication significantly different than the people who haven't been through the same.<br /><br />
          I think the biggest difference between me and people who weren't online as much deals with the concept of "layers of irony".<br /><br />
          People like iDubbbz have made fun of this concept in the past, but I genuinely believe that there's merit to just... engaging with ideas.

          Being able to just test out different things and treat them as if they're serious, even if I don't agree with them, is one of my favorite pasttimes.<br /><br />
          One of the things I hate the most is when somebody calls me back and wants for me to get back to the sincerity level.<br /><br />
          Not that I'm incapable of being sincere, I just... don't want to be?
