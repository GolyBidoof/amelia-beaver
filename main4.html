          One of my traits I struggle to make terms with is the inability to be happy with the current situation, no matter what it is.<br/><br/>
          It's both a blessing and a curse at the same time, because on the upside, it's taken me Places, capital P.<br /><br />
          On the downside, you always, without fail, crave for "something more".
